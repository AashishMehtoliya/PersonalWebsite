                            <p>Cost estimation in any business to track revenue and profit is very important. But it is not very easy because N numbers of factors play to decide the cost estimation.</p><p>But if we know these factors and given adequate data on these factors we can very much predict the cost estimation of a business and prdict the revenue and profit beforehand.</p>
